# Advent of Code 2025
### Day 1: Partridge (Rust)
### Day 2: Turtle Dove (Zig)
### Day 3: French Hen (Go)
### Day 4: Calling Bird (C++)
### Day 5: Golden Ring (Typescript)
### Day 6: Goose-a-Laying (Lua)
(Honestly, it sounded cool at first with singular bird names. By day 6 it hit me with how dumb the names would get from here on out. But, I already made this bed...)
### Day 7: Lord-a-Leaping (Odin)
